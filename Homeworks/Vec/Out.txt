u= [1 2 3]
v= [4 5 6]
u+v= [5 7 9]
u-v= [-3 -3 -3]
2*u= [2 4 6]
-u= [-1 -2 -3]
Vector product of u and v is [4 10 18]
Dot product of u and v is 32
Norm of v is 8.77496438739212
ToString for v: 3D Euclidian vector x=4 y=5 z=6
Absolute Vector Approximate:
Is u ~ v?: False
is v ~ u?: False
Is u ~ u?: True
Define udelta as u + 1e-11*[1 1 1] and check if approximately same
True
Relative Vector approximate: 
is u ~ v?: False
is v ~ u?: False
is u ~ udelta?: True
